PuseRifleStd2
=============

* Standard pulse rifle firmware with Change Notification

This is a single-shot firmware (not autofire) which uses the
Change Notification interrupt for greater responsiveness.

It is intended for use with the AirSoft BB detector (IR LED
and Photo Diode combination) to decrement the counter each
time a BB passes through the infra-red beam.
